Designed a Machine Learning model to predict the ‘Chances of Admission’ of students willing to pursue a Master's degree based on the factors like
GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, etc. using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR), along with Principle
Component Analysis.
The output was predicted with Mean Square Error of 0.042, and R-Square score of 0.821.
